**Homework 5:**
*Part 3: Other Enhancements*

---

To enhance my website and source code, here are the changes that I believe needed improvent.

Changes Made:

- Fix light/dark mode toggle usability for mobile users
    - Prior to HW5, the toggle overlapped the "NT" logo on mobile. I fixed this issue by making a media query to adjust the toggle placement.

- Increase clarity in homepage links
    - I noticed that on my landing page (`home.html`), the links do not indicate that they are clickable. I underlined the text and made it blue so that it's clear that users can click the link.
